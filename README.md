# httpServer-postgressql-API-golang
Simple HTTP Server CRUD to postgressql using Golang Language Program

Hi my name's Dwiyan Ramadhan AKA amonzark. In this github repo I just recently learn how to create an API using gin framework (https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).
This program is really simple no advance code here. You can try it as long you following the instruction here. If you have any concerns feel free to comment.

Big Thanks.
